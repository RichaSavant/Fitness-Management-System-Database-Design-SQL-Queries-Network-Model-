A case study on a "Fitness Management System," which is designed as a mobile application to help users maintain and improve their fitness levels. This application can be downloaded on any mobile device and is intended to be used anywhere, providing features such as activity tracking, metrics tracking, diet and nutrition tracking, progress tracking, sleep tracking, social sharing, and video tutorials. It integrates with wearable devices to synchronize health data and promote healthy behavior changes. The system employs a database schema designed using an ER model, business rules for data management, and SQL queries to handle user information. The network model for deploying the application involves using a Wide Area Network (WAN) at the server side with a hybrid topology and a Local Area Network (LAN) at the client side with a star topology. The application aims to offer an efficient user interface, fast performance, and helpful customer support, making it a competitive product in the market.
